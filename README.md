# Deep-Face-Blurring
Deep-Face-Blurring is a Python-based tool for detecting and anonymizing human faces in images using deep learning models and OpenCV. It leverages YuNet face detection and applies median blurring to protect identities. This project is useful for privacy-preserving preprocessing in datasets, surveillance footage, or public image sharing.
